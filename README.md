# Image-Reconstruction-MSci-Project-
The Python code written and developed by me and my master's project partner, Elliot Prestidge. 
The 'central' script is batch_tomography, which calls functions from within the other scripts.
The code takes the interferograms from the laboratory experiment, applies two tomographic reconstruction algorithms: (filtered back projection (FBP) and the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT).
The tomographic reconstruction is obtained, and the varied roles of the different scripts include: image quality data improvement, performing reconstruction error analysis, and generating simulation data for algorithm testing.
